## The rational

Setup a simple web site acting as a hub listing the incoming events in Sophia-Antipolis.

A lot of great stuff is happening in Sophia:

- meetups
  - [Docker](meetup.com/fr-FR/Docker-Nice)
  - [Hashicorp User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Sophia-Antipolis-HashiCorp-User-Group)
  - [CNCF](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/CNCF-Cloud-Native-Computing-Sophia-Antipolis/)
- events from [TelecomValley](https://telecomvalley.fr)
- events from [RivieraJug](http://rivierajug.org)
- ...

As it's not easy to follow all the sources, some people asks about a hub to list them all...

Here is the attempt to answer this need.

## Status

Early hyper manual version, a lot of stuff needs to be done

- [ ] make a clean and appealing header
- [ ] use template to build index
- [ ] create a backend to automatically fetch events form list of sources
- [ ] Add tab listing past events
- [ ] modify css to have more items on the same page
- [ ] automate deployment of Docker image
